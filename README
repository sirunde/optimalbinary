# Project Proposal
Team members: Gene Ye and Jiyun Park

## Project Type
(2) Select and implement an algorithm that you have learned but have not yet implemented in the course.
Algorithm: Optimal Binary Search Tree - constructing the best possible binary search tree to minimize search time

## Details:
We will build an Optimal BST using dynamic programming based off of what we learned in class. Using Optimal Binary Search Tree, build a searching program based on user input which assigns weights to the different nodes to create a tree with optimal search time. We will both work on building the Binary Search Tree data structure with all the required operations as well as the dynamic programming algorithm and finally coming up with the proper test cases to ensure the code works properly. Each of us will contribute to the final write up based on the parts we worked on and what observations we made while building the project.

We are also going to implement adding new keys in tree, and update values based on frequency of user input.
Finally, we are going to implement both cases in one case to see if it can make big difference.
